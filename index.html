            Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, 
            chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine.

        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Ada Lovelace's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1815</strong> - Born</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1820</strong> - Childhood
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1828</strong> - Flying Machine
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1833</strong> - Ada meets Babbage
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1837</strong> - Ada Marriage
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the
            Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked
            his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria,
            disinfectants, and other applied science.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant
            Pathology
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont,
            leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new
            plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds
            6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including
            different varieties for each major climate on Earth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each
            season, doubling wheat yields
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat
            with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds
            well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding
            strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate
            mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population
          </li>
          <li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically
            increase their maize and sorghum yields
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas
            A&M University
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world
            food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the
            only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says
            that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been
            genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long
            before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
          </li>
          <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
